# Question 1
1. Ask user to enter Num1
2. Ask user to enter Num2
3. Num2>Num1
4. SET Remainder to Num2/Num1
5. If Remainder = 0 then Num1 is a divisor
6. But if remainder â‰  0 then Num1 is not a divisor
7. furthermore if last digit of Num1 is multiple of 2 then Num1 is even, if not then it is odd

# Question 2
1. Ask user to enter Num
2. SET Num parameters tfrom 1 to 12
3. Display "error" if Num>12 or Num<1
4. Assign values 1~12 to the periodic months of the year January~December
5. Output month accroding to respective number

# Question 3
1. Ask user to enter Num1
2. Ask user to enter Num2
3. Initialize Ans = 0
4. Ask user to enter operator from (+,-,/,*,%)
5. if operator is "+", add both Num1 and Num2
6. if operator is "-", subtract both Num1 and Num2
7. if operator is "*", multiply both Num1 and Num2
8. if operator is "/", divide both Num1 and Num2
9. if operator is "%", divide Num1 by Num2, then multiply by 100
10. store value to Ans
11. Output Ans
